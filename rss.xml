            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>So Now We Know How C-3PO Got His Red Arm In The Force Awakens</h1><p>Ladies and gentlemen, our global nightmare is over. After months-nearly five of them in fact-of waiting, Marvel's one-shot comic, revealing just why C-3PO has a red arm for most of The Force Awakens, is finally here. As bizarre as it may sound at first, the final product isn't half bad.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ff7a99fdf22b973fd7d5ffe88bda91f4fec8e32d.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Untold Story of Magic Leap, the World's Most Secretive Startup</h1><p>T There is something special happening in a generic office park in an uninspiring suburb near Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Inside, amid the low gray cubicles, clustered desks, and empty swivel chairs, an impossible 8-inch robot drone from an alien planet hovers chest-high in front of a row of potted plants.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c074a0d302be59dce473c720dd3426bf33ec9c32.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A Collection of Exciting New Booze Books</h1><p>It seems like just about everyone has a cookbook, cocktail manual or spirits' history guide out on the market. A lot of superb ones cross our path with regularity-from new to old -but some really set themselves apart. Most recently we've been digging through four new offerings and each is very different from the next.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/8dbd52c022b397f706e88ffffb31a04f102faa7c.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Chocolate Skateboards + DQM + Mast Brothers</h1><p>Since its humble beginnings as a sister company to Mike Carroll and Rick Howard's Girl Skateboards, Chocolate has grown into one of the more influential brands in skateboarding's surrounding culture. Now 20 years later, with legends like Gino Iannucci and young gun Elijah Berle on the roster, the company shows no signs of slowing.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/09adb57c67d7d90ccdac72399f593aaf7970d3c7.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A Fresh Take On Coffee T-Shirts</h1><p>The coffee shop has always been one of the great incubators for artist-types. It's a home base for creative nomads, where those not shackled to desk jobs go to sketch, write, or just ideate into leather-bound notepads, propped up only by a cup of coffee and, depending on your location and era, a pack of cigarettes.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/99ea5a102a376f1a2a0d9187d3764592ee86f921.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>'Bike to the Future': Design Museum Gent considers a world of two-wheeled design.</h1><p>'Bike to the Future' is the latest testament to a cycling revolution we've been witnessing since the 1960s. But the Design Museum Gent isn't interested in the past; between 25 March - 23 October it showcases a collection of contemporary models from the new millennium, including Philippe Starck's electric bike 'MASS' or Tobias Knockaert's laser-cut bicycle, and prototypes and experiments for the future, with unusual aesthetics, materials and functions.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e75dd9b06e93c20d73aed8ffe8845b13b5208794.jpg"></article>]]></description>
